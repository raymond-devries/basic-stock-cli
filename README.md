# Stock CLI

I created the this project for my brother who wanted a basic method to download data from a particular time frame for a series of stocks. This calculates a specific set of technical indicators desired by him. 

This project requires python 3.8 or above. 

Installation steps.

1. Download the latest whl file. 

2. `pip install *latest whl file*` 

You should now be able to use the cli.

Basic Usage:

`stock-data AMD`

An excel sheet will be generated and saved where the command was run.

To see options:

`stock-data help`
